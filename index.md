## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LUCKYGEORGE666/hxgeorge_chen.github.com/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

## 11/2020 – 02/2021      Prof. Zhidan Liu’s research group, E2E, China Agricultural Univ., China.
## Project (main creator and team leader): Arsenic removal via a novel magnetic hydrochar from livestock manure: fabrication, characterization and directed activation
##    i)	Created and introduced a novel magnetic hydrochar co-activated by thiourea and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles through one-pot synthesis for the             first time;
##    ii)	Systematically characterized the activated hydrochar via EA (element analysis), SEM-EDS, BET study, ICP-OES, XRD, SQUID, XPS, FTIR and  
##        Zeta Potential;
##    iii)Deeply analyzed the As(V) adsorption capacity through kinetic and isotherm models, where the effects of solution pH and background                 electrolytes were specifically investigated.
##    iv)	Discussed the As(V) desorption and reusability of activated hydrochar to achieve comprehensive regeneration.
